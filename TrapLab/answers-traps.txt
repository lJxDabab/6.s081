Q:Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A:a2

Q:Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? 
(Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A:f is inlined in main and g is inlined in f

Q:At what address is the function printf located?
A:0x64a

Q:What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A:ra=pc+4 ,so it is 0x34+4=0x38


Q:Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
A:What is the output? :)
He110 wor1d

Q:The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the 
RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to
 yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A:I'll set 0x00726c64.No,as a string it changes but not as a num.

Q:In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? 
(note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
A:the value of a2.because no argument value is transmitted to a2 while 
it is the default register to pass the 2 th argument.
